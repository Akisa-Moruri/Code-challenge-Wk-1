## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This program calculates the grade of a student based on their marks input. It follows the grading criteria outlined below:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector
This program calculates demerit points for a driver based on the speed of the car. It follows the following rules:

- If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok".
- For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), the driver receives one demerit point.
- If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the program prints "License suspended".

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This program calculates an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. It also calculates the payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary. The program uses the KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the links below:
